### Idea #1: Knowledge completion using knowledge graph

#### Abstract: 
The idea behind this project is to improve text analysis using semantic connections from knowledge graph. A human mind uses contextual information to correctly identify entities in given text. If we are able to link/disambiguate the right candidate entity from the context of the sentences found in text, we can augment the knowledge gained from plain text. 

#### Approach: 
We will use NLP and graph embeddings behind the scenes. From wikipedia articles we can identify named entities. For an identified entity, we need to select entities from our knowledge graph that could correspond to the identified entityâ€™s true entity using graph algorithms.

### Idea #2: Social distancing detection for surveillance cameras

#### Problem Statement: 
This will help stores/governments in detecting social distancing violations in real time using computer vision.

#### Related idea: 
Fire detection. Early detection of fire through cameras using deep learning. This can be extended to geo-locate the fire and alarm concerned parties.

### Idea #3: Image captioning

#### Problem Statement: 
Describing an image in plain text using computer vision and NLP. This tech can be used in image search. Users can search images by entering text query. 

#### Dataset:
Flicker dataset having images and their descriptions, available on kaggle: https://www.kaggle.com/adityajn105/flickr8k
